To run the simulation package:
 - Start by creating a clone of the hktest package 
 - install the other needed packages, velodyne_simulator and grid_map

The next steps are
 - catkin_make 
 - roslaunch hktest testrig_sim.launch t to use gazebo and rviz 
   when the file is launched it starts both rviz and gazebo. It
   is possible to change the gazebo world between the ones already
   constructed or build a new world.
 - To change what is visualized in rviz and how it looks change the urdf.rviz file
